                    Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation
                    of dynamic web applications. Examples of web applications are
                    social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like
                    Amazon.
                </p>

                <p class="highlight">The good news is that learning web development is not that hard!</p>

                <p>
                    In fact, many argue it’s the <a href="#">best form of
                    coding</a> for beginners to learn. It’s easy to set up, you
                    get instant results and there’s plenty of online training
                    available.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A lot of people learn web coding because they want to create the
                    next Facebook or find a job in the industry. But it's also a
                    good choice if you just want a general introduction to coding,
                    since it's super easy to get started. No matter whether
                    you're looking for a career or just want to learn coding,
                    learning how to develop for the web is for you. It's one of
                    the smartest decisions you will ever make!
                </p>

                <h2>Web Development Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    There are two broad divisions of web development:
                    <em>front-end development</em> (also called client-side
                    development) and <em>back-end development </em>(also called
                    <em>server-side development</em>).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees
                    when they load a web application â€“ the content, design and how
                    you interact with it. This is done with three codes HTML,
                    CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML, short for <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">Hyper
                    Text Markup Language</a>, is a special code for 'marking up'
                    text in order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on
                    the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of
                    any web application. CSS, short for <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">Cascading
                    Style Sheets</a>, is a code for setting style rules for the
                    appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of
                    the web. Finally, <a
                    href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> is a
                    scripting language that's widely used to add functionality
                    and interactivity to web pages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of
                    a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate
                    the front-end.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here's an example. Say you log into your Facebook account, and
                    you are greeted with the latest updates in your News Feed.
                    They're not going to be the same updates that you saw
                    yesterday.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How did the page change? Did a Facebook employee manually edit
                    the page to update your news feed? Of course not. A script on
                    the Facebook back-end would have received the updates and
                    re-generated the front-end accordingly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Back-end scripts are written in many different coding languages
                    and frameworks, such as:
                </p>

                <ul>
                        <li>PHP</li>
                        <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                        <li>ASP.NET</li>
                        <li>Perl</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>Node.js</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Without going into more detail, that's really all there is
                    to web development. So now, here are the best ways to start
                    learning it.
                </p>

                <h2>Ways to Learn Web Development</h2>

                <p>
                    The traditional way to learn web development is to enroll in
                    a university or trade school course. However, it can be
                    costly and what's more, the web evolves so fast that
                    schools often can't keep up!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Luckily, there’s plenty of good quality coding training
                    available here on the Internet. What better place to learn
                    web development than the web itself?
                </p>
                <h2>Teach It To Yourself</h2>
                <p>
                     You could also learn web coding by researching it on your
                     own, tweaking website templates and inspecting the source
                     code of other websites. A lot of coders learn HTML and CSS
                     this way, using website editing software to tweak a website
                     template and figuring out the code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, this method is not ideal. It takes a very long time,
                    and you don’t even know what there is to learn. It's like
                    having to first find the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle before you
                    can assemble them.

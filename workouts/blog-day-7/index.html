                    Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation
                    of dynamic web applications. Examples of web applications are
                    social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like
                    Amazon.

                <p>The good news is that learning web development is not that hard!</p>

                In fact, many argue it’s the best form of coding for beginners
                to learn. It’s easy to set up, you get instant results and
                there’s plenty of online training available.

                A lot of people learn web coding because they want to create the
                next Facebook or find a job in the industry. But itâ€™s also a
                good choice if you just want a general introduction to coding,
                since itâ€™s super easy to get started. No matter whether
                youâ€™re looking for a career or just want to learn coding,
                learning how to develop for the web is for you. Itâ€™s one of
                the smartest decisions you will ever make!

                Web Development Overview There are two broad divisions of web
                development â€“ front-end development (also called client-side
                development) and back-end development (also called server-side
                development).

                Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees
                when they load a web application â€“ the content, design and how
                you interact with it. This is done with three codes â€“ HTML,
                CSS and JavaScript.

                HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code
                for â€˜marking upâ€™ text in order to turn it into a web page.
                Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form
                the backbone of any web application. CSS, short for Cascading
                Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the
                appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the
                web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language thatâ€™s widely
                used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.

                Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of
                a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate
                the front-end.

                Hereâ€™s an example. Say you log into your Facebook account, and
                you are greeted with the latest updates in your News Feed.
                Theyâ€™re not going to be the same updates that you saw
                yesterday.

                How did the page change? Did a Facebook employee manually edit
                the page to update your news feed? Of course not. A script on
                the Facebook back-end would have received the updates and
                re-generated the front-end accordingly.

                Back-end scripts are written in many different coding languages
                and frameworks, such asâ€¦

                PHP Ruby on Rails ASP.NET Perl Java Node.js Python Without going
                into more detail, thatâ€™s really all there is to web
                development. So now, here are the best ways to start learning
                it.

                Ways to Learn Web Development The traditional way to learn web
                development is to enroll in a university or trade school course.
                However, it can be costly â€“ and whatâ€™s more, the web evolves
                so fast that schools often canâ€™t keep up!

                Luckily, there’s plenty of good quality coding training
                available here on the Internet. What better place to learn web
                development than the web itself?

                Teach It To Yourself You could also learn web coding by
                researching it on your own, tweaking website templates and
                inspecting the source code of other websites. A lot of coders
                learn HTML and CSS this way, using website editing software to
                tweak a website template and figuring out the code.

                However, this method is not ideal. It takes a very long time,
                and you don’t even know what there is to learn. Itâ€™s like
                having to first find the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle before you
                can assemble them.

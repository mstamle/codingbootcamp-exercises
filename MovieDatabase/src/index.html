                <h3>Jamie Foxx Still Claiming Martin Scorsese Will Direct A Mike
                Tyson Biopic
                    </h3>
                <p>While Martin Scorsese always seems to have a busy schedule,
                it might have opened up slightly given the recent revelation
                that he bailed on that Frank Sinatra biopic. The director’s next
                picture is expected to be the hitman tale “The Irishman,” which
                will reteam him with his longtime friend Robert De Niro, but
                according to Jamie Foxx, Scorsese is still going to make a Mike
                Tyson biopic.</p>
